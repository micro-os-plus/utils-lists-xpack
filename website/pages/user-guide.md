## Rationale

The C++ standard libraries offer comprehensive support for various lists;
however, most of them demand dynamic memory allocations for list nodes
(the objects to store the pairs of links),
which, on embedded systems, may be challenging; thus, when possible,
it is preferred to avoid them, particularly at system level.

## Intrusive lists

One possible way to avoid the dynamically allocated list nodes is
to embed the list links into the payload objects. This is the method
used by the **intrusive** lists. They are double linked lists
that keep two pointers **inside** each linked object. Objects
that belong to multiple lists have multiple pairs of pointers, one
for each list.

At the implementation level, this can be achieved by using composition,
with the objects storing the pairs of links being members of the
payload objects.

@note
The iterators must keep track of the offset from
the object beginning to the location of the pairs of links.

![Intrusive list](intrusive.png)

For lists that are known to be linked into a single list, there is a
simpler variant, with the payload object being derived from the object
storing the pairs of links.

@note
This saves some computations in the iterators, since the
offset to the pair of links is zero.

## Statically initialised lists

In order to support **objects that auto-register themselves** to
**static registrar objects**, which are lists created
via the static constructors mechanism in the global scope,
it is mandatory to guarantee
that the registrar is initialised before the clients need to
register. Given that, as per the C++ standard, the order
in which the static constructors are invoked is not determined,
the only solution is to initialize the registrar
**before** the static constructors.

@note
This initialization is performed by the **startup** code,
when the **bss** section is set to zero.

These statically allocated lists **must not change the
content of any of their members in the constructors**, since this
may very well happen **after** clients have already registered.

Before inserting anything into these lists, the user must call
`initialize_once()`,
the will check the list, and, if still in the initial zero state,
will initialise
it to the empty state (with both pointers pointing to itself).

## C++ API

### Namespaces

The definitions are grouped in a namespace below `micro_os_plus`:

- `micro_os_plus::utils`

### Intrusive double linked lists class

The intrusive lists can be defined by instantiating a class template:

```cpp
 /*
  * @tparam T Type of object that includes the intrusive node.
  * @tparam N Type of intrusive node with the next & previous links.
  * @tparam MP Name of the intrusive node member in object T.
  * @tparam L Type of the links node.
  * @tparam U Type stored in the list, derived from T.
  */
template <class T, class N, N T::*MP, class L = double_list_links,
          class U = T>
class intrusive_list;
```

See the reference [Intrusive double linked lists](group__micro-os-plus-utils-lists-intrusive-lists.html) page.

### Double linked lists class

For simpler use cases, like traditional list or low intrusive lists,
there is a simpler template:

```cpp
 /*
  * @tparam T Type of the elements linked into the list,
  * derived from class `double_list_links_base`.
  * @tparam L Type of the links node (one of
  * `double_list_links` or `static_double_list_links`).
  */
template <class T, class L = double_list_links>
class double_list;
```

See the reference [Double linked lists](group__micro-os-plus-utils-lists-double-lists.html) page.

### Methods

The C++ methods available for the list are:

```cpp
pointer head (void);
pointer tail (void);

void link_tail (reference node);
void link_head (reference node);

pointer unlink_tail (void);
pointer unlink_head (void);

bool empty (void);

void initialize_once (void);
```

Forward iterators are defined as usual:

```cpp
iterator begin ();
iterator end ();
```

Individual nodes (derived from `double_list_links_base`) provide
the following methods:

```cpp
void link_next (double_list_links_base* node);
void link_previous (double_list_links_base* node);

void unlink (void);
void clear (void);

bool linked (void);

// Accessors.
double_list_links_base* next (void);
double_list_links_base* previous (void);
```

## C API

There are no C equivalents for the C++ definitions.

## Examples

An example showing how to use the intrusive lists is available in
[tests/src/sample-test.cpp](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack/blob/xpack/tests/src/sample-test.cpp).

Here are some excerpts:

```cpp
#include <micro-os-plus/utils/lists.h>

class child
{
public:
  child (const char* name);
  // ...
protected:
  const char* name_;

public:
  // Intrusive node used to link this child to the registry list.
  // Must be public.
  utils::double_list_links registry_links_;
};

using static_children_list = utils::intrusive_list<
        child, // type of nodes in the list
        decltype (child::registry_links_), // type of the `registry_links_` member
        &child::registry_links_, // name of member
        static_double_list_links>; // type of the head links node

// The list head is statically allocated.
static_children_list kids_registry;
```

## Known problems

- for statically allocated lists, the destructor cannot revert the
object to the initial zero state; in case the objects are reused, it is
mandatory to clear the memory (via a `memset()`, for example),
before invoking the constructor via placement `new`.
